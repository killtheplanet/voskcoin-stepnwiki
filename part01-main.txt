<h2 id='heading--intro'><a href="#heading--intro">Introduction</a></h2>

This Wiki is all about STEPN, the purpose of this wiki is NOT to re-write or regurgitate the [Stepn White paper](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/) which is excellent and required reading before heading here but to supplement it with additional information as provided by the #Step'N Discussion Discord on the VoskCoin Discord server.


<h2 id='heading--contributing'><a href="#heading--contributing">Contributing</a></h2>

This resource was created because none existed at the time, I am most definitely a noob on this topic and therefore I rely on the community to keep this up to date, so, feel something was missed out or that you can contribute?

The [Stepn Guide](https://stepn.guide/) is a excellent resource that helps with ensuring your shoes have the maximum efficiency for a particular level.
The [Stepn.Wiki](https://stepn.wiki/) site also recently popped up which does a similar job

Note: It has been said that this is only helpful for lower levels not looking at Gem sockets yet

A handy chart which shows the cumulative time and cost to get to a particular level:

<h2 id='heading--minting'><a href="#heading--minting">Minting</a></h2>

There is a good [Minting Calculator](https://stepn.vanxh.dev/) that you can use, keep in mind that mint prices change daily at 14:00 UTC.

A good minting chart:

The 8 June 2022 [announcement](https://stepnofficial.medium.com/stepns-action-plan-for-game-economy-db67fcba405) covers some minting changes:

<b>Below are pre-8 June 2022 changes purely for temporary reference:</b>

Also note that mint costs also change depending on how many mints the shoes has had.

It works roughly like this:

> Basically you are assigned your character with random stats. Then it passively calculates
> steps during the day and turns them into gems. Gems are used to upgrade your character. 
> You also can “battle” another person and you want to select your highest attribute to 
> participate in those as they are weighted the most. For winning those you earn their token.
> WLKN. WLKN can be used to buy clothes and such which upgrade attribute points but you also 
> need them to level up as well. Like to go from lvl 0 to lvl 1 you need 1 WLKN (ty @BrokeAvgJoe)
>
> One note to everyone, if you want: don't level your dude until you have 20 gems and 4 WLKN.
> If you level to lvl 1 you start facing absolute tryhards and it's really annoying. 
> But if you wanna face rad chads, go for it

<h3 id='heading--FAQ-illegalUSA'><a href="#heading--FAQ-illegalUSA">Is it illegal in the USA?</a></h3>

This typically refers to this section of the [agreement](https://agreement.stepn.com/):

> By using the App or the Services you represent and warrant that:
> you are not a current resident of the United States of America, 
> China (Mainland), Cuba, Crimea and Sevastopol, Iran, 
> Afghanistan, Syria, North Korea, Antigua and Barbuda, Hong Kong,
> Thailand, Malaysia, India or Canada (Ontario); and your access
> to and use of the App and Services is lawful in your country 
> of residence in the manner in which you access and use them.


That statement in the TOS doesn’t mean Step’N is banned in those countries. That is the list of countries that are pretty unfriendly towards crypto in general. The 2nd phrase is the important part “and is lawful in your country”
