This Wiki is all about STEPN, the purpose of this wiki is NOT to re-write or regurgitate the [Stepn Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/) which is excellent and required reading before heading here but to supplement it with additional information as provided by the #Step'N Discussion Discord on the VoskCoin Discord server.

This resource was created because none existed at the time, therefore I am most definitely not the most knowledgeable on this topic (and in fact, a noob!), therefore I rely on the community to keep this up to date, so, feel something was missed out or that you can contribute? 

Feel free to raise a [pull request](https://github.com/killtheplanet/voskcoin-stepnwiki) or click on edit on the appropriate file.

Alternatively, tag @killtheplanet on the above-mentioned Discord channel on the VoskCoin Discord with your suggestions!

The [Stepn Guide](https://stepn.guide/) is a excellent resource that helps with ensuring your shoes have the maximum efficiency for a particular level.

Note: It has been said that this is only helpful for lower levels not looking at Gem sockets yet

A handy chart which shows the cumulative time and cost to get to a particular level:

There is a good [Minting Calculator](https://stepn.vanxh.dev/) that you can use, keep in mind that mint prices change daily at 14:00 UTC.

It works roughly like this:
