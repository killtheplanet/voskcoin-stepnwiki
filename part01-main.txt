This Wiki is all about STEPN, the purpose of this wiki is NOT to re-write or regurgitate the [Stepn White paper](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/) which is excellent and required reading before heading here but to supplement it with additional information as provided by the #Step'N Discussion Discord on the VoskCoin Discord server.

The [Stepn Guide](https://stepn.guide/) is a excellent resource that helps with ensuring your shoes have the maximum efficiency for a particular level.

Note: It has been said that this is only helpful for lower levels not looking at Gem sockets yet

A handy chart which shows the cumulative time and cost to get to a particular level:

<h2 id='heading--minting'><a href="#heading--minting">Minting</a></h2>

There is a good [Minting Calculator](https://stepn.vanxh.dev/) that you can use, keep in mind that mint prices change daily at 14:00 UTC.

Also note that mint costs also change depending on how many mints the shoes has had.

It works roughly like this:

Frequently asked questions

Other than buying off the market, you can trade GST you earned in your wallet (once transferred from spending) and click the 'trade' button.
