This Wiki is all about STEPN, the purpose of this wiki is NOT to re-write or regurgitate the [Stepn White paper](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/) which is excellent and required reading before heading here but to supplement it with additional information as provided by the #Step'N Discussion Discord on the VoskCoin Discord server.

The [Stepn Guide](https://stepn.guide/) is a excellent resource that helps with ensuring your shoes have the maximum efficiency for a particular level.

Note: It has been said that this is only helpful for lower levels not looking at Gem sockets yet

A handy chart which shows the cumulative time and cost to get to a particular level:

There is a good [Minting Calculator](https://stepn.vanxh.dev/) that you can use, keep in mind that mint prices change daily at 14:00 UTC.

The 8 June 2022 [announcement](https://stepnofficial.medium.com/stepns-action-plan-for-game-economy-db67fcba405) covers some minting changes:

<b>Below are pre-8 June 2022 changes purely for temporary reference:</b>

Also note that mint costs also change depending on how many mints the shoes has had.

It works roughly like this:

Other than buying off the market, you can trade GST you earned in your wallet (once transferred from spending) and click the 'trade' button.

This typically refers to this section of the [agreement](https://agreement.stepn.com/):

> By using the App or the Services you represent and warrant that:
> you are not a current resident of the United States of America, 
> China (Mainland), Cuba, Crimea and Sevastopol, Iran,

> Thailand, Malaysia, India or Canada (Ontario); and your access

That statement in the TOS doesn’t mean Step’N is banned in those countries. That is the list of countries that are pretty unfriendly towards crypto in general. The 2nd phrase is the important part “and is lawful in your country”

Also from their discord:
